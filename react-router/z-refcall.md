### css

To select all child elements of a <div> except the last child using CSS, you can use the :not and :last-child selectors in combination. Here's the CSS code:

```css
.homeNav :not(:last-child) {
  margin-right: 1rem;
}
```

To select all child elements of a <div>

```css
.homeNav > * {
  margin-right: 1rem;
}
```
